/**
 * Exercises whose logged weight/reps represent ONE limb or side: each hand on
 * its own stack (crossover flys), or one arm/side worked at a time (single-arm
 * rows, behind-the-back moves, oblique work). Their real per-set work is double
 * what you enter.
 *
 * This factor is applied ONLY to aggregates (the Upper Body index and session
 * volume), so that a per-limb movement and a two-limb movement (bar curl,
 * pulldown, press) get equal say. Per-exercise charts and the weekly set counts
 * are deliberately NOT affected, since those stay in the single-side numbers you
 * actually log.
